/// Partner module for the CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) pool system.
/// This module provides functionality for:
/// * Managing partner relationships and permissions
/// * Handling partner registration and validation
/// * Managing partner-specific settings and configurations
/// * Controlling partner access to pool operations
/// 
/// The module implements:
/// * Partner registration and management
/// * Partner permission control
/// * Partner-specific fee handling
/// * Partner access validation
/// 
/// # Key Concepts
/// * Partner Registration - Process of adding a new partner to the system
/// * Partner Permissions - Access rights and capabilities granted to partners
/// * Partner Fees - Fee structures and calculations specific to partners
/// * Partner Access - Validation and control of partner operations
/// 
/// # Events
/// * Partner registration events
/// * Partner permission update events
/// * Partner fee update events
/// * Partner access control events
