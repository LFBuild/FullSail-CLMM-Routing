/// Tick module for the CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) pool system.
/// This module provides functionality for:
/// * Managing price ticks and their boundaries
/// * Tracking liquidity at different price levels
/// * Handling tick state and transitions
/// * Managing tick-related calculations and validations
/// 
/// The module implements:
/// * Tick state management
/// * Liquidity tracking per tick
/// * Price level calculations
/// * Tick boundary validations
/// 
/// # Key Concepts
/// * Tick - A price level in the pool
/// * Tick State - Current state of a tick (liquidity, fees, etc.)
/// * Tick Boundary - Price range limits for a tick
/// * Tick Spacing - Minimum distance between ticks
/// 
/// # Events
/// * Tick state update events
/// * Liquidity change events
/// * Tick boundary crossing events
/// * Tick initialization events
