/// Rewarder module for the CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) pool system.
/// This module provides functionality for:
/// * Managing reward tokens and their distribution
/// * Tracking reward growth and accumulation
/// * Handling reward claims and withdrawals
/// * Managing reward configurations and parameters
/// 
/// The module implements:
/// * Reward token management
/// * Reward growth tracking
/// * Reward distribution logic
/// * Reward claim processing
/// 
/// # Key Concepts
/// * Reward Token - Token used for rewards distribution
/// * Reward Growth - Accumulated rewards per unit of liquidity
/// * Reward Claim - Process of withdrawing accumulated rewards
/// * Reward Configuration - Parameters controlling reward distribution
/// 
/// # Events
/// * Reward token registration events
/// * Reward growth update events
/// * Reward claim events
/// * Reward configuration update events
