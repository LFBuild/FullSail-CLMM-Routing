/// The pool module serves as the core component of the CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) system.
/// It manages liquidity pools, handles swaps, and coordinates various aspects of the DEX including
/// fee collection, reward distribution, and position management.
///
/// Core Functions:
/// - Liquidity Management: Handles adding and removing liquidity from positions
/// - Swap Execution: Processes token swaps with concentrated liquidity
/// - Fee Management: Tracks and collects trading fees
/// - Reward Distribution: Manages reward rates and distribution
/// - Position Tracking: Maintains information about liquidity positions
///
/// Integration with Other Components:
/// - Tick Manager: Manages price ticks and their associated data
/// - Rewarder Manager: Handles reward distribution logic
/// - Position Manager: Tracks and manages liquidity positions
///
/// The pool enables efficient trading with concentrated liquidity while providing
/// infrastructure for fee collection and reward distribution to liquidity providers.
